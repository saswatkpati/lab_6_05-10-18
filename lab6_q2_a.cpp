//This is a program with a function that takes two int parameters, adds them together, then returns the sum. The program should ask the user for two numbers, then call the function with the numbers as arguments, and tell the user the sum.


//including library
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

//Defining function
int add (int a,int b)
{
	int sum;
	sum = (a + b);
}

//asking input
int main()
{
	int s, k, p;
	cout << "Enter your two numbers: ";		
	cin >> k >> p;
	s = add (i,j);				 
	cout << "so the addition is: " << s <<endl;
